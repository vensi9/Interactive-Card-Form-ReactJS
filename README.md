## Overview

### Project

The challenge was to create an interactive card details form where users can fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time. Users should also receive error messages if any input field is empty or if the card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format. Additionally, the layout should be responsive for different screen sizes and include hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements.
